Brain Tumor Recognition Model - README
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Medical Image Tumor Recognition Model focused on detecting brain tumors in MRI scans. The model leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify brain images as having a tumor or not. It aims to aid healthcare professionals in early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors.
Features
- Brain Tumor Detection from MRI images.
- Uses CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification.
- Accuracy of 95% on validation data.
- Pre-trained models (ResNet, VGG16) for feature transfer.
- Simple interface for uploading MRI images and getting predictions.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV
Numpy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Install the required libraries using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used consists of MRI scans of the brain classified into two categories:
1. Tumor
2. No Tumor

You can download the dataset from [here]([https://example.com/dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)). Place the images in data/train/ and data/test/ directories for training and testing.
Model Architecture
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to automatically extract features from MRI scans.
- The model uses multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers.
- Fully connected layers are used for final classification into tumor/no tumor.
- Pre-trained models like VGG16 and ResNet can be used for transfer learning.
Training the Model
1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
2. Run the training script:
python train_model.py
3. The model checkpoints will be saved in the models/ directory.
Evaluation
To evaluate the model on the test set:
python evaluate_model.py
The evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) will be displayed.
Usage
To predict tumor presence in an MRI image:
python predict.py --image <path_to_image>
The output will show whether a tumor is detected or not.
Results
- Accuracy: 95%
- Precision: 93%
- Recall: 92%
